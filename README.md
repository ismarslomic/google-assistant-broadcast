====== IMPORTANT - REPLACED by GOOGLE ASSISTANT SDK in HA! ======

Home Assistant finally provides [Google Assistant SDK integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/google_assistant_sdk) from `v2023.1.0`. It supports broadcasting message without interrupting music/video playback and also sending text commands. This is exactly what you will get with setting up the `google-assistant-broadcast` docker container. Since this covers my needs, and is easier to setup, I will not continue maintaining this repo. You are free to continue/start using it, or forking it to continue improvements.

## Get support

Bugs and questions related to the source code and Docker image can be reported at
[Github Issues](https://github.com/ismarslomic/google-assistant-broadcast/issues) in the

## About

Ever wanted to [broadcast a voice message](https://support.google.com/assistant/answer/9071582) to
your Google Assistant enabled speakers in your home, **without interrupting your music** that is
currently playing? Now you can, and I have tried to make it quit easy for you.

I have made this after a lot of research, and it all started
with [this](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/community-hass-io-add-on-google-assistant-webserver-broadcast-messages-without-interrupting-music/37274)
thread on the Home Assistant forum.

## Broadcasting to all or specific speaker

1. By default, you don't need to prefix the message with `broadcast`, `shout` and `tell` etc. as this is already
   done for you. The message will be broadcast to all speakers connected to your Google account.

2. According to [Google Assistant doc](https://support.google.com/assistant/answer/9071582) you can
   broadcast to specific speakers as well, with the message `Broadcast to <name of the speaker's room>, Hello world.`

## Sending commands to Google Assistant

You can also send commands to Google Assistant, such as `Turn off lights in living room`, by disabling default message
prefix (with `"broadcast"`).

Add environment variable `APPEND_BROADCAST_TO_MESSAGE=false` in your `docker run` command
or `docker-compose` file and send the `POST` request

```json
{
  "message": "Turn off lights in living room"
}
```

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- **docker** - you need to have Docker installed on your machine,
  read [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for more information.
- **Google OAuth 2.0 Client ID** and **Access Keys** - in order to authenticate yourself and get access to your Google
  Assistant
    - You can find help and more information
      at [ismarslomic/google-assistant-oauth](https://github.com/ismarslomic/google-assistant-oauth)

### Alt 1: Run docker container with `docker-compose`

Create a sub folder, ie `/home/pi/config`, and add files `client_secret.json` and `tokens.json`.

`docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  google-assistant-broadcast:
    container_name: google-assistant-broadcast
    image: ismarslomic/google-assistant-broadcast:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "8085:8085"
    volumes:
      - /home/pi/config:/usr/src/config
```

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Alt 2: Run docker container with `docker run`

Create a sub folder, ie `/home/pi/config`, and add files `client_secret.json` and `tokens.json`.

```bash
docker run -d --name google-assistant-broadcast \
-p 8085:8085 \
-v /home/pi/config:/usr/src/config \
--restart unless-stopped \
ismarslomic/google-assistant-broadcast:latest
```

## Using

### Integrating with Home Assistant

You can easily integrate this REST Api in Home Assistant by using the
[RESTful Notifications](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/notify.rest/) platform.

Add following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Google Assistant Broadcast - REST Api
notify:
  - platform: rest
    name: ga_broadcast
    resource: http://localhost:8085/broadcast
    method: POST_JSON
```

### Using in Home Assistant

Broadcast the message by calling the Notification service `ga_broadcast` (from previous step):

```yaml
service: notify.ga_broadcast
data:
  message: Hello world!!
```

### Calling the REST Api directly

**Endpoint**:
POST http://localhost:8085/broadcast

**Request payload**:

```json
{
  "message": "Hello world!!"
}
```

#### Example with curl

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:8085/broadcast \
 -d '{"message":"Hello world!!"}' \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## Known issues

#### 1. Broadcast request gets send, but not played/broadcast to the speakers

I was able to get the container up & running, but when I send broadcast request via
Postman/CURL/Home Asisstant no message is played on my speakers and I get the following lines in
the logs (more details about this issue at [#5](https://github.com/ismarslomic/google-assistant-broadcast/issues/5)):

```(bash)
Sending message: Broadcast Hello world!
[OK] Conversation Response:  empty
[OK] Conversation Completed
```

**Possible solution 1**

Delete existing device registration at Google Actions Console and re-create it, more details
in [comment](https://github.com/ismarslomic/google-assistant-broadcast/issues/5#issuecomment-1151624488)
on [#5](https://github.com/ismarslomic/google-assistant-broadcast/issues/5)

**Possible solution 2**

This issue is related to the language settings we set in the container, when using the
Google Assistant SDK (default is `en-GB`). It's hard to say exactly what the issue is, but for me
it helped to switch from `en-US` to `en-GB`. It might also be necessary to play with the language
settings in the Google Assistant app for the same Google account.

You can try changing the language settings by setting the environment variable `LANGUAGE` to one of the
[supported languages codes](https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/reference/rpc/languages).

Add `-e LANGUAGE=<language_code>` option if running with `docker run` command or `environment` if you
use `docker-compose`:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  google-assistant-broadcast:
    ...
    environment:
      - LANGUAGE=<language_code>
```
